      Let’s believe god created humans, environment, resources, etc. As we delve into the historical context, it becomes evident that the concept of survival of the fittest emerged from the intricacies of evolution, fostering competition for survival. This philosophy aligns with Marx’s perspective, particularly in early societies, where the paramount importance of food for survival became a cornerstone

      As the human population increased the avenues to generate food increased with the help of scientific advancement, epitomized by Green Revolution. The quality of life improved for sure from 1947 when India got independence with 95% of the population illiterate.

      Now that people improved, another set of needs developed like becoming entrepreneurs, sportsmen, bureaucrats, politicians, etc. I agree there will be few folks who become successful, and go further by serving ends and creating an impact on millions’ lives. But for many others, it might be an end in itself and nothing else. They wanted to be in wheat separate from chaff and enjoy success.

      But in the end, none of the scenarios ensure success and life takes its course towards destiny. But the unpopular opinion, in the end, no one remembers a failure, and it’s a myth that it will give you recognition. Yes, as every event has positives and negatives this will also have positives maybe for the next generation to not repeat the mistakes (avoiding re-inventing the wheel situation). It may be useful for you if time permits or in next phase of life. But to get recognition for failure is a premature thought for a young nation like India.
