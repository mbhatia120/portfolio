      # The Evolution of Web Development
  
      When I first started building websites, a simple knowledge of HTML and CSS was sufficient to create impressive pages. Fast forward to today, and the landscape has completely transformed.
  
      ## The JavaScript Renaissance
  
      The evolution of JavaScript from a simple scripting language to the backbone of modern web development marks one of the most significant shifts in our field. Frameworks like React and Next.js have revolutionized how we build user interfaces.
  
      ## From Monoliths to Microservices
  
      Architecture patterns have evolved alongside languages and frameworks. The shift from monolithic applications to microservices and serverless functions has changed how we think about scalability and maintenance.
  
      ## The Rise of Developer Experience
  
      Perhaps the most welcome change has been the focus on developer experience. Tools like TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier have made it possible to write cleaner, more maintainable code with fewer bugs.
