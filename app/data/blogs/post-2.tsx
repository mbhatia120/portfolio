      Human have evolved from chimpanzee to current form. And this took so many years that they forget are what capable of, their are many spirits which just don’t have the courage to take risk, including me. I am yet to find a person who is successful and was risk averse. It might be advisable to hedge your risk, but at the same time no one know what’s in the store. And sometimes its better to not to know every possible outcome/consequences of your decision. Because its outside human capability to account for each variable and optimise it to give favourable result. Then what’s the way out?

      It’s always better to have time-bounded deadlines to meet those goal. And re-strategize your efforts if deadline is not meet to have fulfilling life. Ultimately it’s your faith which will bridge the present to future.
