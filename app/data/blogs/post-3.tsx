      - social mobility happens in rare cases, and that's how nature is built, resources are scarce.
      - you are not different from others, at least not in terms of intelligence.
      - dont take advice from everyone, you have seen more than others because of life experience. u are probably better in predicting the outcomes.
      - some strategy that worked for others will not work for you, there are n variables in the games.
      - hedge well, dont go after what you can't afford.
      - u meet the right girl at the right time, u were lucky.
      - be more professional at work, have clear boundaries between work and personal life.
      - differentiate well between friends and acquaintances.
      - u are not obligated to maintain friendships, u can choose to maintain some based on vibe.
      - your parents will get old faster than u think, spend more time with them.
      - very content you consume has hidden agendas, the creator is trying to sell u something.
      - exercise more, i am unhealthy now because of that.
      - people are in delusion, they dont comprehend the reality of the world.
      - u are weak in literature/arts, u will not be able to write average stuff.
